        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to analyze housing market trends using 
        interactive data visualization techniques. The project identifies pricing 
        patterns and regional variations through meaningful dashboards.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
        Data cleaning and selecting appropriate visualization methods were key challenges. 
        Integrating Tableau dashboards into a Flask web application required careful 
        embedding and layout adjustments.
        </p>

        <h3>Analysis & Utilization of Tableau</h3>
        <p>
        Tableau was used to design interactive dashboards and storyboards. 
        Filters, comparisons, and trend analysis features allow dynamic exploration 
        of housing data insights.
